To generate an ASCII-art based on your picture:
1) copy absolute path to the picture of your choice (for example "C:/Users/.../picture.png" on Windows)
2) when asked insert this path into the console
3) Now you will be asked to input color to replace white and black, if you do not want to replace these, just press Enter
4) If everything went well, a window with final picture should open. By default, the picture is not saved, however,
   you should be able to save it from the window, if you want to.
